Given the arrival rate is 6 processes per minute and the service time is 7 seconds, we can calculate the CPU utilization as (6 * 7) / 60 = 0.7 or 70%.",

The processor stops fetching new instructions following a conditional branch until the branch outcome is known. A program executes 10^9 instructions out of which 20% are conditional branches.

Since 20% of the instructions are conditional branches, the number of branches is 0.2 * 10^9 = 2 * 10^8. Each branch causes a 2-cycle stall (since the branch is resolved in the 3rd stage), so the total stall time is 2 * 2 * 10^8 = 4 * 10^8 cycles. The total execution time is then (10^9 + 4 * 10^8) / 10^9 = 1.4 seconds.",
