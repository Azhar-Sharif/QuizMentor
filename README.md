## vector Db
For QuizMentor we are tring to use a vector database to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional embeddings of quiz questions and student responses. This will allow ua for fast, similarity-based search and personalized quiz generation. By leveraging vector search, the system provides adaptive learning experiences tailored to each student's progress.
## Figma Design
