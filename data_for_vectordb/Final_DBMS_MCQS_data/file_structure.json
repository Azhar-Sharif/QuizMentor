These two tables have to be joined as per a specified join condition that needs to be evaluated for every pair of records from these two tables. The memory buffer space available can hold exactly one block of records for T1 and one block of records for T2 simultaneously at any point in time. No index is available on either table. If Nested-loop join algorithm is employed to perform the join, with the most appropriate choice of table to be used in outer loop, the number of block accesses required for reading the data are",
